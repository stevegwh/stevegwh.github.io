            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Like many of us, I have loved games for as long as I can remember. When I was 10 years old, I ran an RPG website and forum for my friends at school. I was obsessed with Final Fantasy, Baldur's Gate, and the Ocarina of Time and wanted to create something to share with my friends. I always wanted to learn how to make my own games, and I got my start in the year 2000 with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/383730/RPG_Maker_2000/">RPG Maker 2000</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Creators">Dark Basic.</a></p>

            <p>Nowadays, the forum and my old (terrible) game prototypes are long gone. However, my passion for developing games has persisted. I am now a game developer and researcher focused on virtual reality and applied video games.</p>

            <p>However, my path to this point hasn't been straightforward. I graduated in 2011 with a 2:1 in Philosophy and American Studies at Keele University, immediately followed by a Master of Research in Philosophy, which I completed in 2012. From there, I moved to Spain and taught English on a course for university students for six years. In my time in Spain, I was consistently rated as one of the highest teachers in the company across all of our sites. Many of the principles I learnt from making games were applied to my lessons. I had a great time making lessons for my students, iterating on the ideas, and improving them for the next class.</p>

            <p>In around 2015, I decided to return to programming with the intent to make games. I learnt primarily through the work of the excellent <a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/">Daniel Shiffman</a> (JavaScript/Java), completing Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science (<a href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science">CS50</a>) course (C/Python) and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> (JavaScript).</p>

            <p>In 2019, I decided to formalise my knowledge and make the jump to having a career that centres my interests. I got accepted for a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Kent, where I graduated with a distinction. My favourite modules were <a href="https://github.com/stevegwh/cpp-assig-3/blob/master/RingBuffer.hpp">C++ Programming</a> and 3D Graphics and Animation.</p>

            <p>My Master's dissertation focused on virtual reality. I conceived and implemented a technique called '<a href="index.html" onclick="scrollToTargetOnLoad('project-powr')">Prop-Oriented World Rotation</a>.' This technique enables mapping objects from the user's physical environment to objects in the virtual world, allowing users to use virtual objects reinforced by a real-world object. This project was later submitted to the <a href="https://vrst.acm.org/vrst2021/">VRST 2021</a> conferences, where it won the <a href="https://github.com/stevegwh/powr">award for best demo/poster</a>, and later was published as an <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-024-18200-4">academic paper</a> in 2024.</p>

            <p>While studying for my Master's, I worked as a research assistant on a project designing a <a href="index.html" onclick="scrollToTargetOnLoad('project-security')">virtual reality training simulation</a> for a security company based in London. Working with a 3D artist, I was the sole developer of the application and had frequent meetings with the client and project supervisors to assess and adjust requirements and work on features.</p>

            <p>Based on my experience from my Master's, I decided to continue my studies by looking for a PhD scholarships in virtual reality. This led me to be accepted for a PhD at the <a href="https://www.hitlabnz.org/index.php/project/vr-learning-for-firefighters/">Human Interface Technology laboratory</a> in New Zealand, where my research focuses on how best to use virtual reality to train firefighters.</p>

            <p>As part of my PhD, I developed a <a href="index.html" onclick="scrollToTargetOnLoad('project-vrle')">Virtual Reality Learning Environment</a> (VRLE). As part of the development process, multiple industry experts tried my environment and gave great feedback to iterate with. Furthermore, in the (southern hemisphere) summer of 2022, I had an intern join me on the project for six weeks, which taught me much about project management and version control. I ran two user studies with the VRLE, totaling 55 participants, 15 of whom were professional firefighters. I organised and ran part of the second study at a local fire station in Canterbury, NZ, where I got positive feedback.</p>

            <p>I am now close to submitting my PhD and am looking for new opportunities focused on working with video games. It's been a great journey getting here and I would love to find a role where my skillset could be beneficial and used to its fullest.</p>
